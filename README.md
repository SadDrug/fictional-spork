I've come across several stories in AO3 where the pictures included are not available, but are archived in the Wayback Machine. A lot of the time the story is also archived in the Wayback Machine, but some chapters aren't recorded when there are content warnings where an action is needed before the chapter can be accessed. So even when the chapter is missing, the pictures for the chapter are probably archived.

This pages takes an HTML from AO3, runs all the images in the file through Wayback Machine, and replaces the original src of the image with the url of the image saved in the Wayback Machine. Then the modified HTML can be saved.
